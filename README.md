# xAduioEmberMobile
Group Members: Michael Woodham, Robert Gonzales, and Kevin Williams
GitHub Url: https://github.com/Maw1395/xAduioEmberMobile
Project Paper: In The Documentation (Audioember.pdf)

Notes:
The Android Application is in zNewAndroidActivity/2

If Jsoup doesn't run the first time for some reason, add it to your .gradle from the libs folder (It sometimes does that)

We don't claim the project to be perfect, in fact it really isn't by all means, but we feel that it is incredibly useful. 

We would also like to thank you for everything this past semester.

Sincerly,
		AudioEmber Team
